On Linux the default Shell is usually Bash and there is usually **no need to install anything**.

To see if your default shell is Bash type: open a terminal and type `echo $SHELL` and press the `Enter` key. If the message printed does not end with `/bash` then your default shell is something else, and you can run Bash by typing `bash` in the terminal.


Now that you have installed Bash in your system, check out its fundamental commands in the [Typing Bash Commands](05_Typing_Bash_Commands.md) section. Are you already familiar with Bash commands? Then you can proceed to install Git.
