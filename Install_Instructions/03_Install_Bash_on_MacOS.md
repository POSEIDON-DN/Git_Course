The default Shell in some versions of macOS is Bash, so **no need to install anything**.

To see if your default Shell is Bash: open a terminal (found in `/Applications/Utilities`) and type `echo $SHELL` and press the `Return` key. If the message printed does not end with `/bash` then your default is something else, and you can run Bash by typing `bash` on the terminal.


Now that you have installed Bash in your system, check out its fundamental commands in the [Typing Bash Commands](Typing-Bash-Commands) section.
