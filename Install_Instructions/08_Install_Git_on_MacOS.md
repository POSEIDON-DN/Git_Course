For OS X 10.9 and higher, install **Git** by downloading and running the most recent "mavericks" installer from this [list](https://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/). Because this installer is not signed by the developer, you may have to right click (**control** click) on the `.pkg` file; click **Open**; and click **Open on the pop up window**. 

After installing **Git**, there will not be anything in your `/Applications` folder. Do not be afraid! This is just because **Git** is a *command line program*. 

For older versions of OS X (10.5-10.8) use the most recent available installer labelled "snow-leopard" available [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/).

Now that you have installed Bash and Git, you can proceed to check out the material found in the `Training_Material/` directory.
