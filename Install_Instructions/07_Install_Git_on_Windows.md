**Git** should be installed on your computer as part of the **Git Bash** install. 

If you skipped the **Installing Bash** part, go to [Install Bash on Windows](02_Install_Bash_on_Windows.md) and follow the instructions there to install **Git Bash** (and hence, install Git for Windows).

Now that you successfully installed Bash and Git on Windows, you can proceed to check out the material found in the `Training_Material` directory.
