# Git Training Material

In this repository you will find training material on how to install and do version control with Git.

## What will you find here?

The repository structure consists of 3 directories:

- `Install_Instructions/` which contains Markdown files specifying Git installing instructions for different operating systems.  
- `Training_Material/` which contains Markdown files that should be followed in sequential order (each file name starts with a number, which specifies the order in which the files should be followed). 
- `Figures/` which contains the figures shown in the Markdown files.

## Remarks

The material exemplifies the use of Git in a Windows device (using Git-Bash terminal), but instructions are applicable to all operating systems. In addition to that, Gitlab is used as the remote repository platform. But overall the instructions also apply to Github users.
