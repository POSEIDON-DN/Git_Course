# Git Training Material

In this repository you will find training material on how to install and do version control with Git. 
 

## What will you find here?

The repository structure consists of 3 directories aside this README file and the LICENSE file:

- `Install_Instructions/` which contains Markdown (.md) files specifying **Bash** and **Git** installing instructions for different operating systems.    
- `Training_Material/` which contains Markdown (.md) files that should be followed in sequential order (each file name starts with a number, which specifies the order in which the files should be followed). At the end of each, you can also find the links to the **previous** and **next** file following the sequential order.
- `Figures/` which contains the figures shown in the Markdown files of this repository.


## Preparation

In order to be able to follow the material provided in this repository, you are asked to install **Bash** and **Git**. The instructions on how to install them can be found in the  `Install_Instructions/` directory (start with the `00_Start_Here.md` file, and follow the instructions specified there).


## Remarks

The material exemplifies the use of Git in a Windows device (using Git-Bash terminal), but instructions are applicable to all operating systems. In addition to that, Gitlab is used as the remote repository platform. But in general the instructions are also applicable for Github repositories.
